# Customer Churn Prediction Project

Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, is a critical concern for businesses across various industries. It refers to the rate at which customers discontinue their services or subscriptions with a company. Understanding and predicting customer churn is of paramount importance as it helps businesses proactively identify at-risk customers and implement strategies to retain them, ultimately improving customer satisfaction and revenue.

In this project, we explore customer churn prediction using a Telco churn dataset. We perform extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset and understand the factors contributing to customer churn. We then experiment with various machine learning models to determine which one yields the best predictive performance. Additionally, we identify and extract the most important features contributing to churn prediction.

## Project Goals

- Understand the concept of customer churn and its significance for businesses.
- Explore the Telco churn dataset through EDA to uncover patterns and trends.
- Preprocess and clean the data for machine learning.
- Experiment with different machine learning models to predict customer churn.
- Evaluate model performance and select the best-performing model.
- Identify and extract the most important features contributing to churn prediction.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Telco Customer Churn dataset, which contains information about customer demographics, services they are subscribed to, contract details, and whether they have churned or not.


## Conclusion

Customer churn prediction is a crucial task for businesses aiming to retain their customer base and improve revenue. This project aims to provide insights and practical solutions to address customer churn using machine learning techniques and feature analysis. By understanding the factors that drive churn, businesses can develop proactive strategies to retain their customers and improve customer satisfaction.
